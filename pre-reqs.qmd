You will need:

-   [R and RStudio](#install-r-and-rstudio)\
-   To [install some packages](#packages)
-   To connect to [Discord](#discord), for in-class interaction

## Install R and RStudio {#install-r-and-rstudio}

<!-- last-minute-tag -->

We will use:

-   R version == 4.5
-   RStudio == 2025.05

However, as long as you are using R \>= 4.2, and a recent version of RStudio, you should be fine.

## Install packages {#packages}

Most of the packages we use are imported by **`tidyverse`** and **`devtools`**:

``` r
install.packages(c("devtools", "tidyverse", "palmerpenguins", "here"))
```

In case of any installation problems, you will also have access to a Posit Cloud hosted RStudio project.

## Discord {#discord}

<!-- last-minute-tag -->

During the workshop we will have experienced helpers to troubleshoot and will use Discord to enhance workshop interactions:

-   [Please sign up for an account](https://discord.com/) if you don’t already have one.
-   Make sure your [display name](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/12620128861463-New-Usernames-Display-Names#h_01GXPQABMYGEHGPRJJXJMPHF5C) is the one you used to register for the conference.
-   In your “About Me”, put the name of your workshop(s).

The posit::conf Discord server is open and you can access it via the event portal at [pos.it/conf-event-portal](https://pos.it/conf-event-portal). You can then join the channel for this workshop: `#workshop-r-programming`
